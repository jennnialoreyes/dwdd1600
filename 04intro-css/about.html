   <h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Jennifer, a graphic design student at Utah Valley University, originally from Mexico. My work is often inspired by nostalgia and personal memories.</p>
<p>I love exploring simplicity and experimenting with different contrasts to create designs that feel calm yet expressive. My goal is to make visuals that connect with emotions and tell quiet stories through color and form.</p>

    <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
<p> 
    I find inspiration in everyday moments, and nostalgia plays a big role in my creativity. I enjoy looking back at old photos and memories to spark my ideas and bring that sense of softness and warmth into my designs.
</p>

    <h2>My design philosophy</h2>
<p> 
   Sometimes we don’t feel confident about a project because it looks messy or it doesn’t turn out how we imagined. We end up putting it aside and not finishing it. But what it really matters is to just finish it, even if it looks bad. Once you finish it, you can move on to other projects and keep improving with experience. Then, later on, you can always go back and make those old projects better.
